# step1. Getting some Jobs data:
Use the github jobs API to retrieve all 226 (or how ever many there are by late Jan)
get each of the 5ish pages of jobs, put them into  a single collection (list/arraylist etc)

# step2. More data
add the data from stackoverflow jobs to database

# step3. Visualizing data
Display a map visualization with the jobs that have saved to database 
Technology: matplotlib or plotly to do the mapping
*Display a filtered list of jobs on the map.
*Allow the user to filter by job technology, age of the job posting or company. Allow one other kind of filter of your choice. Tell me about it in your readme.
*Allow the user to select a job from the map and see details about that job (or all jobs in that city/town if you prefer)
*Use a graphical user interface of any kind to do the filter selection and display the job details
